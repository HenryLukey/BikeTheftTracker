# BikeTheftTracker
Created for "web development" module at university, using JavaScript, HTML, PHP, CSS, MySQL, and the Google Maps API.

Designed to allow users to upload images and information about their bikes, and report them as stolen, giving the last known location of the bike as additional info through Google Maps. Police accounts can view all the stolen bikes, and add reports about the investigation.
